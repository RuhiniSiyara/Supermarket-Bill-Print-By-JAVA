# Supermarket-Bill-Print-By-JAVA
I created a program to calculate a full bill to a customer, when they given their name, contact and the quantities of their items. The customer-given amount get as user input at the end  of the bill print. After user input, the system should calculate the change. After calculation, System  should print Net Amount, Cash and Change
